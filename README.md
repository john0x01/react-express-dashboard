## Usage

```
cd server/ | npm run server & cd client/ | npm start
```
or
```
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

## How does it works?

### Requesting data

Once the application is running, the component `App.jsx` will make an axios request to the server and store the received data.

```
const [backendData, setBackendData] = useState([{}])

useEffect(() => {
    axios.get(baseApiUrl)
        .then(res => res.data)
        .then(data => setBackendData(data))

}, []) 
```

### Submiting data

In order to submit data into the system, you'll have to edit `db.json` file located on `server/db.json`.

The JSON file in an array with months represented by objects that go like this:

```
{ 
    "month": "oct-22", 
    "revenue": 3450,
    "soldGoodsCosts": 1650,
    "operatingCosts": 1980,
    "currentAssets": 1359,
    "currentLiabilities": 4010,
    "taxes": 0.12 
},
```
The other variables displayed on the dashboard are calculated from these in the database

### Calculating Variables

There are two functions on the **App Component** that use `backendData` to calculate the other variables:
  1. `getChartsArrays` which returns an object containing separated arrays for every month revenue, outgoing and balance
  2. `calculateVariables` which also returns an object containg specific variables of the defined month (if not defined, will be the latest).
  These are: 
    1. Percentage
    2. Outgoing
    3. Gross Profit
    4. Operating Profit
    5. Net Profit

The 1st function is used for the charts and the 2nd for the displayed cards.
